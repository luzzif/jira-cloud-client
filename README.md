# Jira Cloud client

A lightweight Jira Cloud REST API's client leveraging OAuth 1.0.

### Contributing

#### Commit Message Format

Each commit message must consist of a **header** and an optional **body**,
separated by an empty line.

#### Header

Format: `[type]: subject`.

**type** must have one of the following values:

* **feat**: a new feature
* **fix**: a bug fix
* **docs**: documentation only changes
* **style**: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
  formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: a code change that improves performance
* **test**: adding missing tests
* **chore**: changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such
  as documentation generation

**subject** is a succinct description of the change and:

* uses the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* doesn't capitalize the first letter
* has no dot (.) at the end

#### Example

```
[chore]: initial commit
```
